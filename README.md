# ATM-Project-Using-C
the project is a course-based project for the subject "Programming through C".
This was created during the second semester of our college time, while everyone were introduced to the programming world for the first time. Applying C language concepts to build an entire ATM application aided in learning coding as how it must be learnt.
Beginners to a programming language may adapt this learning, (thanks to my institute for the idea) and take inspiration from this project and learn and enjoy the world of programming. Happy coding :)
